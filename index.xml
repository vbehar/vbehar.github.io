No existing tool really matches our needs, so I created Octopilot: a CLI tool designed to help you automate your Gitops workflow, by automatically creating and merging GitHub Pull Requests to update specific content in Git repositories.

I contributed multiple new features and bug fixes to Osiris.
As the original project has now been archived, I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining a fork on the Dailymotion OSS organization - as well as how to use it in Jenkins X.</description></item><item><title>Kaniko</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/kaniko/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/kaniko/</guid><description>Kaniko is &amp;ldquo;a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster&amp;rdquo;.
In 2018 when I started using Jenkins X to power our CI/CD pipelines on Kubernetes, I quickly identified Kaniko to build our container images.
Unfortunately, as explained in the Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X blog post I wrote, I found a few bugs which I fixed in Kaniko:
Fix for multi-stage builds Fix to allow building multiple images using the same container I also added a few new features:</description></item><item><title>Flowdock to Elasticsearch</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/flowdock2es/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/flowdock2es/</guid><description>In 2014, I wanted to play with Elasticsearch and Kibana, so I created a small project to import data from a Flowdock instance into Elasticsearch, and then build a Kibana dashboard to visualize the Flowdock usage.
It is written in Scala and uses the Flowdock REST API to retrieve data, and the Elastic4s scala lib to populate the Elasticsearch index. I also contributed to the Elastic4s open-source project.
Here is a screenshot of the Kibana dashboard:</description></item><item><title>OpenShift</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/openshift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/openshift/</guid><description>OpenShift is a Kubernetes &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; developed by Red Hat.
In the summer of 2015 I started using this newly announced platform, and as always when working with new projects, found a lot of opportunities for improvements.
This is how I contributed new features, bug fixes, bug reports and documentation in:
OpenShift Origin - including support for custom Dockerfile path when building Docker images OpenShift source-to-image - the tool used to build container images without using Dockerfiles OpenShift Documentation I also contributed to the OpenShift completion for oh-my-zsh plugin.</description></item><item><title>Cascading Flapi</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/cascading-flapi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/cascading-flapi/</guid><description>In 2013, we were using Hadoop at Exalead, writing data processing pipelines with Cascading. But Cascading&amp;rsquo;s Java API was&amp;hellip; not very friendly to use.
I wanted a more &amp;ldquo;fluent&amp;rdquo; API, so I wrote an OSS project on top of Cascading to provide a fluent API. I used Flapi, which is an API generator for Java, &amp;ldquo;generating &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; interfaces for improved fluency in your code&amp;rdquo;.
The cascading-flapi project was used at Exalead to help write our data processing pipelines&amp;hellip; until switching to Spark.</description></item><item><title>Elastic4s</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/elastic4s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/elastic4s/</guid><description>Elastic4s is an Elasticsearch client for Scala.
In 2014, while working on a Scala-based CMS - Content Management System - with an integrated search engine based on Elasticsearch, I found myself using the Elastic4s open-source project. And as it often happens, not all our use-cases were covered by the existing features, so I contributed a few new features.
See all my contributions.
At some point I also became a committer on the project.</description></item><item><title>Paris DevOps</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/parisdevops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/parisdevops/</guid><description>In 2011, soon after the creation of the Paris DevOps Meetup group, I joined the team and help organize the meetups.
I built the parisdevops.fr using Jekyll on GitHub Pages: https://github.com/parisdevops/parisdevops.github.com
