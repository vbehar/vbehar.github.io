At the beginning of 2019, I wrote a blog post on [Dailymotion's Medium publication](https://medium.com/dailymotion) titled **Dailymotion's journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X**:

- it got more than 20k views in 1 year,
- it was re-published on [CloudBees blog](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/jenkins-to-jenkins-x),
- it was translated in chinese by [Wang Donghui](https://github.com/donhui), and published on [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.cn/article/YWkOx7t4gQyO-64KZ186).
