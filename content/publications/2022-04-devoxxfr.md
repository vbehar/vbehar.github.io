At the [Devoxx France](https://www.devoxx.fr/) 2022 conference, I gave a talk titled **How OpenTelemetry can transform your monitoring by unifying your logs/metrics/traces** - in French.

In this talk, I our experience using OpenTelemetry at Ubisoft, and how it helped us to unify our monitoring data.

I shared how we use the OpenTelemetry Collector in a Kubernetes environment, and a unified platform based on Grafana Tempo, Loki and Prometheus.
