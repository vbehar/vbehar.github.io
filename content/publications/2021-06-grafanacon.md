At the [GrafanaCONline 2021 Conference](https://grafana.com/about/events/grafanacon/2021/), I gave a talk titled **Using Grafana to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators in the open source Jenkins X cloud native CI/CD project** - yes, I'm competing for the longest conference talk title!

In this talk, I shared how we are using Grafana in Jenkins X for everything observability-related, and more specifically to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators:
- why Grafana
- how Grafana is setup in a Kubernetes cluster
- how the CD indicators application is exposing its dashboards and datasource for Grafana to consume

[You can watch the talk on the Grafana website](https://grafana.com/go/grafanaconline/2021/jenkinsx-grafana/).
