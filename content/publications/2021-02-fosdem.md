At the [Fosdem 2021 Conference](https://fosdem.org/2021/), I gave a talk titled **Collecting and visualizing Continuous Delivery Indicators** _in a Kubernetes-based CI/CD platform, using Jenkins X, Lighthouse, Tekton, PostgreSQL and Grafana_ in the [CI/CD devroom](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/).

In this talk, I shared our experience at [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/) on:
- defining CD Indicators
- collecting them from a Kubernetes-based CI/CD platform
- storing them in PostgreSQL
- visualizing them using Grafana
