I was interviewed by [Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) and [Liz Fong-Jones](https://twitter.com/lizthegrey) from the [Observability Podcast (o11ycast)](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/).

We talked about [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), Continuous Delivery, and how we've joined the 2 together in [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/).
