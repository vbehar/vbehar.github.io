At the [Continuous Delivery Paris](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Continuous-Delivery) meetup, at the [march 2019](https://www.meetup.com/Paris-Continuous-Delivery/events/259467027/) session, I gave a talk titled **Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments**.

In this talk, I focused on [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) Preview Environments, and how we are using - and abusing - them at Dailymotion, to build and test our ad-tech platform:
- what is a preview environment, how it works and its lifecycle
- how we are testing "managed services" using preview Environments
- how we are customizing the environments using Helm
- how we are managing the environments and avoiding too many idle resources with [Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris)
