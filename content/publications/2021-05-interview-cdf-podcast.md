I was interviewed by [Jacqueline Salinas](https://twitter.com/salinas_jacq) from the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) podcast: [The Pipeline: All Things CD & DevOps](https://cd.foundation/podcast/).

We talked about how we are using and contributing to [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) at [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com/):
- our story with Jenkins X
- our contributions - the web UI & the observability stack - and why we contribute
