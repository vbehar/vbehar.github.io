At the [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2021/cdcon/) conference, in june 2021, I gave a talk titled **How Jenkins X is Integrating Observability from the Inside, and the Benefits for its Users**.

In [this talk](https://cdcon2021.sched.com/event/ios0), I explained what observability means for a Continuous Delivery platform such as [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/), and why it's important.

I went through how Jenkins X v3 is integrating observability from the inside, using standards such as [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and packaging a full observability stack using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - with [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), Promtail, [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/), and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

I highlighted the benefits for the users:
- platform observability with alerting for all the Kubernetes components ([Lighthouse](https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse), [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/), [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/), ...)
- out-of-the-box dashboards for Continuous Delivery Indicators (Mean Lead Time, Time To Review, Release, and Deployment Frequency, ...)
- distributed traces for your pipelines
