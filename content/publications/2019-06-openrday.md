At the [Open R&Day 2019 Conference](https://openrday.oodrive.fr/) in Paris, I gave a talk titled **Our journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X**.

In this talk, I first introduced [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/), and then went through some of the benefits we gained by switching [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/) ad-tech platform's CI/CD pipelines to Jenkins X: Preview Environments, easy promotion, Gitops, ...

I also explained how we adopted Jenkins X and did the migration, and finished with our open-source contributions as part of this migration.

Note that this talk is in french.
