In 2020, while building Dailymotion's new Continuous Delivery platform, I found myself needing a tool to automate the creation of pull requests to implement our Gitops-based workflow. No existing tool really matches our needs, so I created [Octopilot](https://github.com/dailymotion-oss/octopilot): **a CLI tool designed to help you automate your Gitops workflow, by automatically creating and merging GitHub Pull Requests to update specific content in Git repositories.**

You can read more about Octopilot in a blog post I wrote on [Medium](https://vbehar.medium.com/): [Introducing Octopilot: a CLI to automate the creation of GitHub pull requests in your gitops workflow](https://vbehar.medium.com/introducing-octopilot-a-cli-to-automate-the-creation-of-github-pull-request-in-your-gitops-e49b9eb0177a).
