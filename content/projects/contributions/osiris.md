[Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris) is "*a general purpose, scale-to-zero component for Kubernetes*". As explained in the [Zero cost preview environments on Kubernetes with Jenkins X and Osiris](/publications/2019-02-article-osiris/) blog post I wrote, Osiris is an excellent tool to keep a [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) cluster size under control.

I [contributed multiple new features and bug fixes to Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris/issues?q=author%3Avbehar).

As the original project has now been archived, I'm maintaining a fork on the [Dailymotion OSS organization](https://github.com/dailymotion-oss) - as well as [how to use it in Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/admin/guides/preview-environments/).
