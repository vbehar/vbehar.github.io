In August 2015 I developed a Web Dashboard for visualization of multi-projects resources in OpenShift.\nThis gave me the opportunity to learn the OpenShift/Kubernetes API early on, and improve my Go skills - by reading the OpenShift and Kubernetes code bases.\nNote that the Kubernetes Dashboard was only created in October 2015 - a few months after this project.\nSee the project GitHub repository for more information.\nOpenShift Cucumber We had quite a few applications to deploy to on our OpenShift cluster, and found ourselves writing more and more YAML files, to define our applications: deployment configs, but also build configs, OpenShift templates, routes, services, service accounts, roles, secrets, projects, and so on. I wanted to ensure that changes to these files won\u0026rsquo;t break anything.\nOur applications used a variety of languages: Go, Scala, Java, Javascript, so I selected a language-agnostic way to write tests: Cucumber tests, using BDD - Behavior-Driven Development.\nThis is how I wrote OpenShift Cucumber: a collection of Cucumber steps definitions for the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs. Think of it as the ancestor of both Helm Chart Tests and the Helm Unit Test plugin - just before Helm was even created.\nSee the project GitHub repository for more information.\nOpenShift GitHub Hooks This is a Kubernetes \u0026ldquo;controller\u0026rdquo; used to automatically manages GitHub hooks for OpenShift BuildConfig triggers. When working on a platform with lots of applications, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to repeat the same tasks over and over, so you automate. You write tiny scripts first, and then production-ready software. This is a production-ready software we\u0026rsquo;ve been using to provide a self-service platform to application developers.\nSee the project GitHub repository for more information.\nOpenShift/Git Integration A Kubernetes \u0026ldquo;controller\u0026rdquo; used to automatically import/export OpenShift resources from/to a Git repository. Well, in fact, it only does the \u0026ldquo;export\u0026rdquo; part - the \u0026ldquo;import\u0026rdquo; was planned but never developed.\nThe short term goal of this tool was to automatically backup our OpenShift resources in a Git repository, thus enabling audit \u0026amp; history features on top of the Kubernetes API. That part has been developed and worked well, and helped us a lot.\nThe long term goal - which was never developed - was to do the opposite: read configuration from Git and apply it automatically to our OpenShift cluster. Gitops before the name was even born.\nSee the project GitHub repository for more information.\nOpenShift Flowdock Notifier We were happy users of Flowdock as our communication tool, mainly for its Inbox feature, which makes it easy to separate communication between people and automatically-generated messages from different tools.\nThis project is a Kubernetes controller used to send automatic messages to Flowdock based on events happening in the OpenShift cluster. For example to be notified when a build is finished.\nIt was never finished, I had in mind to use the Kubernetes TPR (Third Party Resources) - the ancestor of the CRD (Custom Resources Definition) - to allow the users to define rules of events that would generate Flowdock notifications.\nSee the project GitHub repository for more information.\nNone of these projects are maintained or used anymore.\n","permalink":"https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/openshift-projects/","tags":["OpenShift","Kubernetes","Go","Open Source"],"title":"Various OpenShift-related projects"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In 2011, I wrote a blog post on the Paris DevOps Meetup website, explaining on we adopted a DevOps mindset at RTL, step by step:\n starting with basic communication tools, such as a common \u0026ldquo;chat\u0026rdquo; tool - Jabber - between devs and ops sharing data - logs - and tools to access them working together on automation tools getting devs to deploy their applications themselves and the impacts  You can read the full blog post - in french.\n","permalink":"https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2011-04-article-cd/","tags":["Blog Post","DevOps"],"title":"Confessions of an anonymous developer"},{"categories":null,"contents":"At the Paris DevOps meetup, at the march 2011 session, I gave a talk titled Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck with my colleague Bruno.\nBruno presented Rundeck first, and how it can be used to automate operations.\nAnd then I explained how we used it at RTL, to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Nexus:\n for our staging environment, we enabled a continuous deployment workflow - which we called \u0026ldquo;0-click deployment\u0026rdquo; for our production environment, we enabled a continuous delivery workflow - which we called \u0026ldquo;1-click deployment\u0026rdquo;  Read the full meetup report - in french.\n  ","permalink":"https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2011-03-meetup-paris-devops/","tags":["Talk","Meetup","DevOps","CI/CD","Jenkins","Rundeck"],"title":"Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Jenkins X is a CI/CD platform on top of Kubernetes.
