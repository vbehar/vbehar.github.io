Since 2020, I started contributing more to Jenkins X by creating new components, mainly for observability - but also web UIs.
JX Pipelines Visualizer The first new project I created for Jenkins X was the JX Pipelines Visualizer: a web UI to visualize the pipelines and their logs.

In this talk, I explained what observability means for a Continuous Delivery platform such as Jenkins X, and why it&amp;rsquo;s important.
I went through how Jenkins X v3 is integrating observability from the inside, using standards such as OpenTelemetry, and packaging a full observability stack using Grafana - with Loki, Promtail, Tempo, and Prometheus.</description></item><item><title>Using Grafana to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators in the open source Jenkins X cloud native CI/CD project</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2021-06-grafanacon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2021-06-grafanacon/</guid><description>At the GrafanaCONline 2021 Conference, I gave a talk titled Using Grafana to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators in the open source Jenkins X cloud native CI/CD project - yes, I&amp;rsquo;m competing for the longest conference talk title!
In this talk, I shared how we are using Grafana in Jenkins X for everything observability-related, and more specifically to visualize Continuous Delivery Indicators:

The first part is a walk-through of a GitHub WebHook event coming to the cluster until it results in a running Tekton Pipeline. It explains how Prow understands the webhook event, &amp;ldquo;kind of&amp;rdquo; forwards it to Jenkins X, which retrieves the right pipeline to execute and translate it into a format that Tekton can understand.</description></item><item><title>1 year with Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-12-dwjw-lisbon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-12-dwjw-lisbon/</guid><description>At the DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Conference in Lisbon, I gave a talk titled 1 year with Jenkins X.

More specifically, about Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s ad-tech platform move to Google Cloud Platform and to Kubernetes, and its adoption of Jenkins X to run its CI/CD pipelines.
We talked about our custom implementation of Jenkins X, and open-source contributions. And of course the benefits of the migration.

In this talk, I first introduced Jenkins X, and then went through some of the benefits we gained by switching Dailymotion ad-tech platform&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipelines to Jenkins X: Preview Environments, easy promotion, Gitops, &amp;hellip;
I also explained how we adopted Jenkins X and did the migration, and finished with our open-source contributions as part of this migration.</description></item><item><title>Our experience running Jenkins X in production</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-04-cdconference/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-04-cdconference/</guid><description>At the Continuous Delivery in a Cloud Native World virtual summit, in april 2019, I gave a talk titled Our experience running Jenkins X in production.
In this talk, I explained Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s reasons for selecting Jenkins X to run the ad-tech platform CI/CD pipelines, and shared our experience using it in production:
how we keep our Preview Environments under control using Osiris to scale them down to 0 when they are not used how we promote our releases to staging/production on different Kubernetes clusters using Helmfile – and the benefits of it.</description></item><item><title>Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-03-meetup-paris-cd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-03-meetup-paris-cd/</guid><description>At the Continuous Delivery Paris meetup, at the march 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments.
In this talk, I focused on Jenkins X Preview Environments, and how we are using - and abusing - them at Dailymotion, to build and test our ad-tech platform:
what is a preview environment, how it works and its lifecycle how we are testing &amp;ldquo;managed services&amp;rdquo; using preview Environments how we are customizing the environments using Helm how we are managing the environments and avoiding too many idle resources with Osiris Using Jenkins X at @dailymotion talk by @vbehar #ci #cd pic.</description></item><item><title>Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</guid><description>At the Cloud Native Computing Paris meetup, at the february 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X.
