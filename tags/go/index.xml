No existing tool really matches our needs, so I created Octopilot: a CLI tool designed to help you automate your Gitops workflow, by automatically creating and merging GitHub Pull Requests to update specific content in Git repositories.
You can read more about Octopilot in a blog post I wrote on Medium: Introducing Octopilot: a CLI to automate the creation of GitHub pull requests in your gitops workflow.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins X Projects</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/jenkins-x-projects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/jenkins-x-projects/</guid><description>I started using Jenkins X in 2018, and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing to the project.
Since 2020, I started contributing more to Jenkins X by creating new components, mainly for observability - but also web UIs.
JX Pipelines Visualizer The first new project I created for Jenkins X was the JX Pipelines Visualizer: a web UI to visualize the pipelines and their logs.
New @jenkinsxio UI to visualize your pipelines and logs: https://t.</description></item><item><title>Various OpenShift-related projects</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/openshift-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/openshift-projects/</guid><description>In 2015-2016, while using OpenShift, I developed a few small open-source projects on top of the Kubernetes/OpenShift APIs:
OpenShift Dashboard OpenShift Cucumber OpenShift GitHub Hooks OpenShift/Git Integration OpenShift Flowdock Notifier OpenShift Dashboard When I started using OpenShift, I quickly realized that it was missing a global view of the cluster state. In August 2015 I developed a Web Dashboard for visualization of multi-projects resources in OpenShift.
This gave me the opportunity to learn the OpenShift/Kubernetes API early on, and improve my Go skills - by reading the OpenShift and Kubernetes code bases.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/jenkins-x/</guid><description>Jenkins X is a CI/CD platform on top of Kubernetes. I started using it while it was still a young project, in september 2018.
I made various contributions:
code, of course - including bug fixes and new features documentation and blog posts on the Jenkins X blog support on the community Slack channels demos at Office Hours - see recordings on YouTube talks at conferences and meetups, and interviews on podcasts &amp;hellip; I also got a few awards, such as:</description></item><item><title>Helm Ecosystem</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/helm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/helm/</guid><description>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It is the tool most people use to package their applications, and then deploy on Kubernetes. It is also the core of an ecosystem growing every day: plugins, wrapper tools, charts, &amp;hellip;
I have been contributing to a few open-source projects in the Helm ecosystem:

As explained in the Zero cost preview environments on Kubernetes with Jenkins X and Osiris blog post I wrote, Osiris is an excellent tool to keep a Jenkins X cluster size under control.
I contributed multiple new features and bug fixes to Osiris.
As the original project has now been archived, I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining a fork on the Dailymotion OSS organization - as well as how to use it in Jenkins X.</description></item><item><title>Kaniko</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/kaniko/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/kaniko/</guid><description>Kaniko is &amp;ldquo;a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster&amp;rdquo;.
In 2018 when I started using Jenkins X to power our CI/CD pipelines on Kubernetes, I quickly identified Kaniko to build our container images.
Unfortunately, as explained in the Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X blog post I wrote, I found a few bugs which I fixed in Kaniko:
Fix for multi-stage builds Fix to allow building multiple images using the same container I also added a few new features:</description></item><item><title>OpenShift</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/openshift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/openshift/</guid><description>OpenShift is a Kubernetes &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; developed by Red Hat.
In the summer of 2015 I started using this newly announced platform, and as always when working with new projects, found a lot of opportunities for improvements.
This is how I contributed new features, bug fixes, bug reports and documentation in:
OpenShift Origin - including support for custom Dockerfile path when building Docker images OpenShift source-to-image - the tool used to build container images without using Dockerfiles OpenShift Documentation I also contributed to the OpenShift completion for oh-my-zsh plugin.</description></item></channel></rss>
